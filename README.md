# CodingTheory
Program written in Java for Coding Theory module. It encodes binary/text/image input (using convolutional codes), sends through noisy channel (you can choose error probability) and decodes data back to normal using feedback decoder.    
Engine.java file contains encoding, decoding and noisy channel algorithm.

GUI.java file contains text/image conversion to bits and other graphical user interface functions.  

If you are using Windows, you can download, compile and run the program using the compile.bat and run.bat files to test out the program!
